Code written for "The Elements of Computing Systems" projects. I highly recommend the book for those interested in learning how elementary transistor chips are scaled to build a full-fledged computer with an operating system. I found the materials covered in this book condusive in filling many of the knowledge gaps I had in understanding what's going on behind the scene when the code I write is executed by a computer hardware.
